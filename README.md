# Bugs

 - <s> none :tada: </s>

# ToDo

 - signing and mozilla/chrome addon account
 - FEATURE: write import and export to json feature. prepare json files (trump, cyber, cloud)
 - be proud & happy!!! first addon :) yay <3 :tada: :clap: :smile:

# Maybe

 - styling?
 - test with safari and opera?

# Done

 - x the dom tree gets traversed multiple times, this makes the order of rules unimportant
 - x regexes should be compiled only once
 - x always handing over the settings via a parameter -- there has to be a better way … ask on SO (this is not really a bug) (thought about it for a minute and used a class instead of functions …
 - x maybe hide the addon button so it's more pranky? (apps always get an icon or placeholder if they do not define one)

# Prerequisites

 - firefox build: ``jq``
 - firefox development: [extension auto installer](https://github.com/palant/autoinstaller)
