# Bugs

 - catch json could not be parsed exception

# ToDo

 - signing and mozilla/chrome addon account
 - prepare json files (trump, cyber, cloud)
 - clean and style gui
 - be proud & happy!!! first addon :) yay <3 :tada: :clap: :smile:

# Maybe

 - test with safari and opera?

# Done

 - x the dom tree gets traversed multiple times, this makes the order of rules unimportant
 - x regexes should be compiled only once
 - x always handing over the settings via a parameter -- there has to be a better way … ask on SO (this is not really a bug) (thought about it for a minute and used a class instead of functions …
 - x maybe hide the addon button so it's more pranky? (apps always get an icon or placeholder if they do not define one)
 x change firefox version so a recent version is used (45 is not working)
 x icon copyright/license (choose/make something better?). using <https://pixabay.com/en/abstract-animal-art-blue-1296709/> licensed under CC0 Public Domain (Free for commercial use.
